### About the project
Simple API to receive facial recognition data captured on mobile devices. This data will be used to restore facial data to other devices

### Tech Stack

- Express
- MySQL
- Jest Testing Framework

### Usage
A Postman collection has been added to this project to test the endpoints: [FacialRecognitionWebAPI.postman_collection.json](FacialRecognitionWebAPI.postman_collection.json).
To start the application, run `npm start`

### Tests
To run tests, run `npm test`

### Fun fact
I had to write a simple API to receive data for a demo we were experimenting with.
I mostly do stuff like this with PHP and Laravel, but today I decided to challenge myself. Why Not :) ?
This is the result of my experiment with NodeJS and Express.
